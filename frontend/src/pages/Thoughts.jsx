    <h1>Bandwidth Salon ðŸ’­</h1>
    <p className="thoughts-intro">
      Hi this is Saloni, I created this page to share my thoughts behind building Bandwidth Salon. Imagine this: youâ€™re leading a crucial video call, everythingâ€™s going perfectlyâ€¦ and then your Wi-Fi drops
    </p>
    <div className="thoughts-screenshots-row">
      <figure className="thoughts-figure">
        {/* connection-error.png */}
        <img src="/images/connection-error.png" alt="Sorry, an unexpected error occurred." />
      </figure>
      <figure className="thoughts-figure">
        {/* payment-form-error.png */}
        <img src="/images/payment-form-error.png" alt="There was an issue loading the credit card form." />
      </figure>
    </div>
    <p className="thoughts-followup">
      This happened to me, two different Wi-Fi accounts, two red banners of doom, zero mercy. If only Iâ€™d seen the drop coming, I couldâ€™ve dodged the awkward silence.

    <h2>Why I Built Bandwidth Salon</h2>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
      A little warning can save your day. Hereâ€™s what you can do with a heads-up:

    <ul>
      <li>Switch to a hotspot before disaster strikes</li>
      <li>Alert your ISP before your meeting tanks</li>

    </ul>
